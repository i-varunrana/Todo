### [View Demo](https://i-varunrana.github.io/todo/)

Simple todo using MVC application in plain JavaScript

### Purpose

Learn the MVC pattern by building a small app!

- **Model** - manages the data of an application
- **View** - a visual representation of the model
- **Controller** - links the user and the system

This application consists of `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`. This means that there are no framework or dependencies getting in the way of learning the MVC concept.
